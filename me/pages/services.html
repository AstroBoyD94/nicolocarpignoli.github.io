                    <h1>Development</h1>

                    Development of Augmented Reality experiences that run on the browser, without install any app on mobile phones.
                    Web AR websites run on every smartphone and browser (iOS Safari, Android Chrome and Firefox).
                    Experiences features marker-based AR and location-based (geolocation) AR, and are built using AR.js.
                    Development goes from design to implementation.

                    It's possible to create markers with QR Code around them, in order to create a single anchor that both redirect
                    the user to the website and make it possible to see AR content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Consultancy</h1>

                    Consultancy about Augmented Reality experiences, built with AR.js. This service is suggested
                    for those who have already built an AR experience but have encountered a problem or wanted better perfomances.
                    A first consultancy can be followed by formation or development of a project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Formation</h1>

                    Formation about Augmented Reality experiences, built with AR.js. This will make possible for
                    developers, artists, designers, to learn how to build Augmented Reality websites.
                    Formation sessions feature Q&A, teaching, slides sharing and issue solving.
                    It's suggested for those who want to be autonomous in building Web AR experiences, and
                    not just develop one single project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also available for Web Accessibility formation and consultancy about principles and best practices
                    in order to create Accessible websites.
