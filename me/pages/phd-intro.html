                <p>Tactile graphics are images that provide visual information on a tactile form, so users can perceive shapes on surfaces and get spatial information (Dias et al. 2010, 1; Loch 2008, 37). They come in the form of tactile maps, tactile pictures, tactile diagrams, etc. Users can be sighted or blind people but this technique is often used and designed for the blinds.</p>

                <p>From the 19th century lots of psychologists, designers and engineers have strived in order to create a standard, tactile reading code. They succeed and nowadays we have Braille, Moon and also other derivations of Braille, that is currently the most used tactile reading code (Cooper 2006, 2; Cryer et al. 2008, 8).</p>
                <p>We cannot say the same for Tactile Graphics (TGs): a standard way to create them, useful in every context, is still to be found. This particular aspect - the purpose of TGs - seems to be one of the most important variables that are to be taken into account in order to design them. This means that TGs used in a book for children, for example, need to be designed in a certain way; TGs used for maps in history or geography have other different aspects that need to be taken into account. The same for architecture, and so on (Darras e Valente 2010, 8).</p>

                <p>Another important challenge that still presents several problems for researchers is the design flow for TGs, and it is strictly related to the way the human brain perceives the information. We can think about the TGs reading as a three-phase mechanism: first, the user has to touch the surface, so his/her fingers can receive tactile feedback (sensory mechanism phase). Then, this information is sent to the human brain through the nervous system, and tactile stimuli are processed (processing phase). Now comes the most important and yet scientifically less understood part, the conversion of those stimuli into information, the so-called ‘meaning’ phase (Whitehouse e Jacobson 1999, 105). In this phase several aspects play an important role, from cultural ones to previous knowledge of shapes and world objects, animals, people. Studies (Urbas et al. 2016, 66; Darras e Valente 2010, 7, 8, 12) have found differences between the comprehension of TGs between blind and sighted users. This answers in part also to the differences between perception of the same TGs from congenital blind people and later blind people with a visual memory of objects. Also, acuity - the ability to perceive textures and shapes with touch - has to be taken into account as it can change for sighed and blind people, and it decreases with age (Stevens, Foulke, e Patterson 1996, 101).</p>
                <p>All these challenges and variables make it difficult for a sighted person to effectively design TGs for the blind, potentially the users that are using this technology most. To effectively design for the blind, TGs designers should be helped by blind people through the process of creation with continuous testing (Darras e Valente 2010, 15; Urbas et al. 2016, 67).</p>

                <p>Still, TGs are very important for the blind in order to understand shapes and spatial relations between them (Urbas et al. 2016, 63; Sheppard e Aldrich 2001, 69; Tennison et al. 2020, 7:2). This is true for math, science in general and also geography (Ladner et al. 2005, 1). This seems the reason for the misconception in some countries like India about blind people which are not able to have good school results - and eventually professional careers - in those specific topics and are thought as not good enough; instead, the reason may be they have less tools to efficiently learn those topics in respect of their sighted colleagues (Dias et al. 2010, 3).</p>
                <p>Moreover, TGs reduce the feeling of exclusivity given by codes like Braille, because they can be read also by sighted people without tactile codes knowledge. This helps the collaboration and support between sighted and blind people (for example for teachers with blind pupils).</p>

                <p>TGs can be treated, technically, as raised prints. This concept comprehends several techniques to work with paper or plastics in order to create raised surfaces, like embossing, vacuum form, thermography, collage of textures, etc. (Valente 2010, 61; Urbas et al. 2016, 64; Ladner et al. 2005, 152). There is also the possibility to create 3D scaled artifacts that represent buildings, animals, art sculptures. They are called plastic molds and are used in education and in museums, while raised prints are used mostly on paper and so in books for pleasure and educational purposes (Dias et al. 2010, 3).</p>


                <p>While TGs on paper (raised prints) are the preferred standard, they present several problems for a large scale adoption. This approach requires trained personnel to author and produce resources (Tennison et al. 2020, 7:2), also production costs are high because print on paper requires ad-hoc printers - costs can be a little lower if using Braille printers, but this still require to use paper and thus it makes sharing of printed resources difficult (Dias et al. 2010, 2).</p>

                <p>In recent years, a lot of developers and designers are trying to investigate the adoption of digital resources and general purpose devices, instead of relying on analogical assets or ad-hoc devices.</p>
                <p>More specifically, several researchers are trying to explore if vibrations on smartphones and tablets can act as useful feedback stimuli in order to convey graphical information (Tennison et al. 2020, 7:2).</p>

                <p>A recent study from Tennison et al (Tennison et al. 2020) has proven that vibrations on general purpose devices can be used to effectively convey graphical information to blind users. In the same study, a ready-to-use open source library for the android operating system has been developed, and researchers have found three different vibrations that can effectively reproduce, for the users, the following information: a dotted line, a dashed line and a solid line.</p>
                <p>Starting from this study and other recent findings, we aim to understand how to combine these vibrations elements in order to convey more complex information like graphs, maps and possibly more complex TGs than geometrical shapes on general purpose devices. The aim is to provide a more portable and inexpensive way to produce and share TGs for every user that needs them.</p>
