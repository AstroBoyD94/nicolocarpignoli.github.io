            My name is Nicolò Carpignoli, I'm a webxr developer from Italy.
            I'm working for Chia lab, a design and software company based in Bologna.
            You can find more about me on Github at nicolocarpignoli,
            On twitter at nicolocarp,
            On medium at nicolcarpignoli.
            I'm here to make easier for you to start with Augmented Reality on the Web.
            From now on we will refer to it as 'WebAR'.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Let's start from definitions. What is AR?
            AR for me is a new communication medium. It's new for the market, not for the tech.
            It makes you see content over the reality. This can make you learn in different ways,
            see things differently, you can feel more engaged with the content itself, because it's situated
            in your environment. You can feel it closer to you and more real.
            Situated content can be also more accessible (for example, Augmented sign language books).
        </p>

            Some examples of AR use cases can be:
            I’d like to see how this new furniture fits on my room, the colors, the size,  etc... before buying it.
            I’d like to learn biology, or anatomy: this 3D model I see, in real sizes, over my textbooks, is really helping me to understand sizes, to see every side of it, every detail, etc… and I can interact with it, it’s so cool and helpful!
            I want to explore my city, walking in the historic center and see new places I do not know. To see anchors on my phone camera, where places really are, with some indications and distance, is helping me to find them.
            I’m abroad and I have too much text in front of me in a language I do not know, I don’t have time to type it all on a translator: I will use this AR app that translates that to me in real time. Also, it’s chinese and I’m italian, how do I even type it ?
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            AR comes in different types: markerless, image tracking, location based, marker based. We will see each of them later, in detail, talking about technologies.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Why are we talking about AR on the Web?
            Because now it's possible to use AR on every user's phone, and it makes sense because this way,
            we can make AR content and apps collaborative, and build them easily.
            For example, to have a mobile apps instead of a web app, it means:
            For developers, to have
            High costs of development, build and release
            To have a Macbook for iOS, developer licenses for both Android/iOS
            To release a new app at every bugfix or feature.

            For users, it means:
            To find an app on the stores
            To install an app  (storage issues)
            To keep it updated
            To remember to delete it.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Today we're going to talk about several, free and open source WebAR technologies.
            AR.js, WebXR Device API, jsartoolkit, model viewer and jeelizAR.
