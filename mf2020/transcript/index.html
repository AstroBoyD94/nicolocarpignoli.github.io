            My name is Nicolò Carpignoli, I'm a webxr developer from Italy.
            I'm working for Chia lab, a design and software company based in Bologna.
            You can find more about me on Github at nicolocarpignoli,
            On twitter at nicolocarp,
            On medium at nicolcarpignoli.
            I'm here to make easier for you to start with Augmented Reality on the Web.
            From now on we will refer to it as 'WebAR'.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Let's start from definitions. What is AR?
            AR for me is a new communication medium. It's new for the market, not for the tech.
            It makes you see content over the reality. This can make you learn in different ways,
            see things differently, you can feel more engaged with the content itself, because it's situated
            in your environment. You can feel it closer to you and more real.
            Situated content can be also more accessible (for example, Augmented sign language books).
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Some examples of AR use cases can be:
            I’d like to see how this new furniture fits on my room, the colors, the size,  etc... before buying it.
            I’d like to learn biology, or anatomy: this 3D model I see, in real sizes, over my textbooks, is really helping me to understand sizes, to see every side of it, every detail, etc… and I can interact with it, it’s so cool and helpful!
            I want to explore my city, walking in the historic center and see new places I do not know. To see anchors on my phone camera, where places really are, with some indications and distance, is helping me to find them.
            I’m abroad and I have too much text in front of me in a language I do not know, I don’t have time to type it all on a translator: I will use this AR app that translates that to me in real time. Also, it’s chinese and I’m italian, how do I even type it ?

            AR comes in different types: markerless, image tracking, location based, marker based. We will see each of them later, in detail, talking about technologies.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Why are we talking about AR on the Web?
            Because now it's possible to use AR on every user's phone, and it makes sense because this way,
            we can make AR content and apps collaborative, and build them easily.
            For example, to have a mobile apps instead of a web app, it means:
            For developers, to have
            High costs of development, build and release
            To have a Macbook for iOS, developer licenses for both Android/iOS
            To release a new app at every bugfix or feature.

            For users, it means:
            To find an app on the stores
            To install an app  (storage issues)
            To keep it updated
            To remember to delete it.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            Today we're going to talk about several, free and open source WebAR technologies.
            AR.js, WebXR Device API, jsartoolkit, model viewer and jeelizAR.
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            AR.js is written in Javascript and it features Marker Based, Image Tracking and Location Based AR.
            It's cross browser, working on almost every android and iphones of last 5-6 years.

            Marker Based means that when we scan a marker, so a simple image sorrounded by a black border,
            we can show content on top of it. Content will disappear if the camera lost the marker.

            Instead Image Tracking uses the same 'marker' behaviour but in this case we can use real pictures
            and not simple barcodes or qrcodes like images.
            So we can augmented drawing, pictures, art, and make them live, for example starting from a movie poster
            and animate it with a 2D video overlayed on it.
            Content can be 3D models, videos, images, even audio. It uses aframe, a framework based on HTML and Javascript,
            that makes easy to create content on the Web for AR and VR, that is, Virtual Reality.

            Instead, location based AR uses real-world coordinates to place AR content in context. Users can move freely (outdoors for better precision) and content associated with their location will be scaled and placed accordingly (e.g: content will render bigger / smaller based on distance to the user).
            It can be used t0:
            Show Augmented Reality informations of places walking on a park, a street, etc.
            For Cities and museum tours, restaurant guides, treasure hunts, biology or history learning games or place virtual art on any real world location
            to create GPS based games (Pokèmon GO-like).
        </p>
        <p tabindex="0">
            You can even create markers inside QRCodes with custom qr code creators, in order to make the user, with a single scan,
            to reach your website thanks to the qrcode and to see AR content with the marker within it.

            AR.js is cross browser and features three important AR types, but still requires
            programming knowledge to be used, to create web ar with it and deploy it live on a website.
